# ThirdFridayChallenge

# What Was the Challnge?
The challenge was to create a Jenkins pipeline that ran, tested and pushed an app to a nexus repository every time it was pushed/pulled from github.

# How I expected the challenge to go
Considering I was on holiday for 3 of the days, I expected to be behind the curve, as each day is so impactful in terms of knowledge gained to be able to really give the challenge a solid attempt, so my expectation wasn't too high. Although I was hopeful I would be able to use the skills acquired in previous weeks to complete certain aspects of the challenge.

# What went well?
I understood what was required of me, in the sense that the logic of the task was clear to me, but I didnt have the hours under my belt this week to fully understand the processes. I also believe that I gave it a fair attempt at trying to ascertain how to complete certain steps before asking for help, but due to the time restraints of having to hand in before 3pm and other work related commitments in the morning, I did eventually have to reach out for help to be able to provide some kind of submission.

# What didn't go as planned?
My days holiday probably took more of a toll than I had hoped in the respect that I knew what I was trying to achieve, but the nature of scripting and other elements of this week's task, execution and accuracy were paramount in ensuring I completed it correctly. 

# Possible improvements for the future:
Although I couldn't avoid the days holiday that I did take this week, I do plan to seldom take holiday in the future, especially this side of Christmas, to ensure that I don't struggle on a task again. Having now experienced 3 weeks of the academy, it is evident that the structure of the academy is that each week's learning flows sequentially into the following week, as opposed to just different topics every week, which does reinforced my plan to limit holidays as and where I can. With that said, Ben has recorded lessons so I do plan to catch up on those recordings over the weekend to ensure that I can proceed confidently with the final week of this month's academy on Monday.
